# We now enter start-up mode

The most exciting times with lots of small tasks to do!

# After class

Let's go through the assignments! It takes a long time but it will help you get into the rhythm. I will not do this throughout the course.

Once we are done, I recommend that you sit with your group and coordinate, delegate and solve the `create_a_pr_to_repositories_py` assignment immediately.

I will generally be available after classes but only if you need to discuss group-specific matters.

Course questions should still be asked in Teams or during class time.
